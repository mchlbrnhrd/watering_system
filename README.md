# watering_system

You need an Arduino, water pump, relais module and a humidity sensor. For example "WayinTop Automatische Bew√§sserung DIY Kit".

This software supports
* start pump when humidity is too low
* start pump after time out (e.g. after one day)
* stop pump when humidity is high enough or after a timeout (e.g. after 20 seconds)
* interact via terminal (seriell monitor of arduino IDE)
  - start and stop pump manualy
  - change values of variables (thresholds, times)
