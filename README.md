# watering system
Water plants automatically on vacation.

You need an Arduino microcontroller, water pump, relais module and a humidity sensor. For example "WayinTop Automatische Bew√§sserung DIY Kit". 

This software supports
* start pump when humidity is too low
* start pump after time out (e.g. after one day)
* stop pump when humidity is high enough or after a timeout (e.g. at least after 20 seconds)
* interact via terminal (seriell monitor of arduino IDE)
  - check sensor values
  - start and stop pump manualy
  - change values of variables during runtime (thresholds, time durations)
  - activate debug mode: print sensor values continously and internal states of software.
  
# hardware setup
Connect digital outputs of arduino (microcontroller) with relais module inputs. Connect analog inputs of arduino with humidity sensors. Connect pumps with relais module switches and power supply.
  
# requirements
This software supports following requirements:
* R1: If pump is on then after time T1 there shall be a humidity change (below threshold S3). Otherwise go to error state.
* R2: If humidity is lower than threshold S1 then pump has to be activated.
* R3: If humidity is higher than threshold S2 then pump has to stop.
* R4: Maximum time for pump is on is time T2.
* R5: Wait time T3 after last time pump was on before pump can be activated again.
* R6: If after time T4 earth is to dry then start pump (maybe sensor is defect).
* R7: When in error state then start new trial after time T5 and go to ready state.
* R8: Requirements R1 - R7 works independent for each available pump.

States/Modes:
* M1: pump is ready
* M2: pump is on
* M3: pump is off
* M4: pump is in error state
